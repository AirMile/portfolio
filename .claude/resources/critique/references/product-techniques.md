# Product Analysis Techniques

These techniques are specifically for product ideas: apps, services, businesses, and commercial offerings.

## Feasibility Analysis

**When to use:** Always relevant for product ideas. Assesses if the idea is technically and financially realistic.

**Approach:**
- What are the technical requirements and challenges?
- What resources (time, money, people, skills) are needed?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- What are the financial constraints and costs?
- Are there technology or resource blockers?

**Output structure:**
- Technical feasibility (easy/moderate/hard/impossible)
- Resource requirements breakdown
- Cost estimates (rough order of magnitude)
- Timeline assessment
- Critical blockers identified
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Target Audience Deep Dive

**When to use:** When the product serves specific users or customers.

**Approach:**
- Who exactly is this for? (demographics, psychographics, behaviors)
- Why would they use this instead of alternatives?
- What is their current pain point or need?
- How do they currently solve this problem?
- What would make them switch or adopt this?
- Are there different user segments with different needs?

**Output structure:**
- Primary user persona(s)
- Pain points and needs per segment
- Current alternatives they use
- Value proposition per segment
- Adoption barriers
- User motivation analysis

## Market Gap Analysis

**When to use:** To understand if there's real demand and differentiation.

**Approach:**
- What problem does this solve?
- Is this a real problem people/businesses face?
- How are people solving this now?
- What's missing in existing solutions?
- Is the gap significant enough to matter?
- Who else is trying to fill this gap?

**Output structure:**
- Problem definition and validation
- Current solution landscape
- Gap identification (what's missing/broken)
- Market opportunity size assessment
- Competition attempting to fill gap
- Differentiation strategy

## Competitive Analysis

**When to use:** When similar products or services exist in the market.

**Approach:**
- Who are the direct and indirect competitors?
- What do they do well? What are their weaknesses?
- How is this idea different or better?
- What would competitors do in response?
- Is there a defensible competitive advantage?

**Output structure:**
- Competitor landscape (direct and indirect)
- Competitive strengths and weaknesses
- Differentiation points
- Competitive response scenarios
- Defensibility assessment
- Strategic positioning recommendations

## Monetization Potential

**When to use:** For any product idea that needs to generate revenue.

**Approach:**
- How can this make money?
- What are potential revenue models? (subscription, one-time, freemium, ads, B2B, etc)
- What would users/customers pay for?
- What is the pricing sensitivity?
- What are unit economics estimates?
- Are there multiple revenue streams?

**Output structure:**
- Potential revenue models
- Pricing strategy options
- Willingness-to-pay assessment
- Unit economics rough estimates
- Revenue stream diversification
- Financial sustainability analysis

## Scalability Analysis

**When to use:** For products that aim to grow beyond initial launch.

**Approach:**
- Can this handle growth in users/customers?
- What breaks at scale? (technical, operational, cost)
- Are unit economics favorable at scale?
- What resources scale linearly vs non-linearly?
- What are scaling bottlenecks?

**Output structure:**
- Scalability assessment (high/medium/low)
- Bottlenecks at different scale levels
- Cost structure at scale
- Operational complexity assessment
- Infrastructure requirements
- Scaling roadmap considerations

## User Experience Journey

**When to use:** For apps, digital products, or service experiences.

**Approach:**
- How does the user discover, onboard, and use this?
- Where are friction points in the journey?
- What causes users to drop off?
- Are there moments of delight or "aha" experiences?
- How does the experience evolve over time?

**Output structure:**
- End-to-end journey map (discovery → retention)
- Friction points and drop-off risks
- Engagement peaks and valleys
- Onboarding effectiveness assessment
- Retention mechanisms
- Experience optimization opportunities
