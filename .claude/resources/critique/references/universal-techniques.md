# Universal Analysis Techniques

These techniques are applicable to any type of idea—creative, product, or service.

## Devil's Advocate Analysis

**When to use:** Always relevant. Identifies potential failures and weaknesses.

**Approach:**
- What could go wrong with this idea?
- What assumptions are weak or unproven?
- Why might this idea NOT work?
- What obstacles will be encountered?
- What counterarguments exist?

**Output structure:**
- Major concerns (ranked by severity)
- Weak assumptions identified
- Potential failure modes
- Obstacles and challenges

## Assumption Testing

**When to use:** When the idea relies on unvalidated beliefs about users, technology, or market.

**Approach:**
- What assumptions underpin this idea?
- Which assumptions are critical vs nice-to-have?
- How can each assumption be tested?
- What happens if key assumptions are wrong?

**Output structure:**
- List of core assumptions
- Risk level per assumption (high/medium/low)
- Testing methods for validation
- Contingency plans if assumptions fail

## Alternative Approaches

**When to use:** To explore different paths to the same goal.

**Approach:**
- What other ways exist to solve this problem?
- What are simpler/cheaper/faster alternatives?
- What trade-offs does each approach have?
- Why is the proposed idea better than alternatives?

**Output structure:**
- 3-5 alternative approaches
- Comparison table (complexity, cost, time, effectiveness)
- Trade-off analysis
- Justification for original approach or pivot recommendation

## Ethical Implications

**When to use:** When the idea affects people, society, or raises moral questions.

**Approach:**
- Who could be harmed by this idea?
- What are potential misuse cases?
- Are there privacy, fairness, or bias concerns?
- What unintended consequences might arise?

**Output structure:**
- Potential harms identified
- Vulnerable groups affected
- Mitigation strategies
- Ethical boundaries to establish
