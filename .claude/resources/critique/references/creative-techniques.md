# Creative Analysis Techniques

These techniques are specifically for creative concepts: games, stories, art, music, and other artistic projects.

## Narrative Structure Analysis

**When to use:** For stories, games with narrative elements, or content-driven experiences.

**Approach:**
- Does the narrative arc work? (setup, conflict, climax, resolution)
- Are character motivations clear and consistent?
- Is pacing appropriate for the medium?
- Are there plot holes or logical inconsistencies?
- How does the structure serve the theme?

**Output structure:**
- Story structure breakdown
- Character arc analysis
- Pacing assessment
- Plot consistency check
- Structural strengths and weaknesses

## Thematic/Conceptual Analysis

**When to use:** For any creative work exploring themes, messages, or artistic concepts.

**Approach:**
- What is the core theme or message?
- Is the theme communicated effectively through the concept?
- Are there contradictions between theme and execution?
- How deep or surface-level is the thematic exploration?
- Does the concept add something new to this theme?

**Output structure:**
- Core themes identified
- Theme-execution alignment
- Depth assessment
- Originality of thematic approach
- Suggestions for stronger thematic integration

## User Experience Journey

**When to use:** For games, interactive experiences, or any creative work the audience engages with over time.

**Approach:**
- How does the user/player/reader experience this step-by-step?
- Where are friction points or confusion likely?
- Does the pacing maintain engagement?
- Are there moments of delight, surprise, or emotional impact?
- How does the experience evolve over time?

**Output structure:**
- Step-by-step journey map
- Engagement peaks and valleys
- Friction points identified
- Emotional arc analysis
- Improvement opportunities

## Technical Constraints

**When to use:** For games, digital art, interactive media, or technically complex creative projects.

**Approach:**
- What technical requirements does this idea have?
- Are these requirements realistic given current technology?
- What are the performance/resource limitations?
- What technical skills or tools are needed?
- Are there simpler technical approaches?

**Output structure:**
- Technical requirements list
- Feasibility assessment (easy/moderate/hard/impossible)
- Resource and skill needs
- Alternative technical approaches
- Technical risks and mitigations

## Scalability Analysis

**When to use:** For creative projects that might grow (game content, story series, art collections).

**Approach:**
- Can this concept sustain expansion?
- What are natural extension points?
- Will the core concept remain interesting at scale?
- Are there diminishing returns in expansion?
- What would break if scaled up?

**Output structure:**
- Scalability potential (high/medium/low)
- Natural expansion paths
- Risks of scaling
- Content sustainability assessment
- Recommendations for scope
