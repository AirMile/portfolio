# Brainstorm Techniques

These techniques help creatively expand ideas through exploration, variation generation, and boundary pushing. Use these when you want to discover new possibilities, alternatives, and unexpected directions for your idea.

## Creative Expansion Techniques

### 1. What If Scenarios

**When to use:** To push boundaries and explore provocative variations of the core concept.

**Approach:**
- What if we changed [core element] completely?
- What if this existed in [different context/world]?
- What if we removed [constraint] entirely?
- What if we added [extreme element]?
- What if [opposite of current approach]?

**Output structure:**
- 5-10 provocative "what if" scenarios
- Brief exploration of each scenario's implications
- Most promising scenarios highlighted
- Unexpected directions discovered

### 2. Analogical Thinking

**When to use:** To find innovative solutions by connecting to totally different domains.

**Approach:**
- What other fields solve similar problems differently?
- What does this idea remind you of in nature? In other industries? In history?
- How would [different profession] approach this?
- What unexpected parallels exist?
- What can we learn from [unrelated domain]?

**Output structure:**
- 3-5 analogies from different domains
- Key insights from each analogy
- Transferable concepts identified
- Novel approaches inspired by analogies

### 3. Reversal/Inversion

**When to use:** To discover alternatives by flipping the concept upside down.

**Approach:**
- What if we did the exact opposite?
- Instead of [X], what if [opposite of X]?
- Reverse the user journey—what happens?
- Invert the problem—what would make this worse?
- Flip assumptions—what if [assumption] is wrong?

**Output structure:**
- Core elements identified
- Reversals/inversions for each element
- Surprising insights from inversions
- Viable alternative approaches discovered

### 4. First Principles Thinking

**When to use:** When you need to rebuild the idea from fundamental truths.

**Approach:**
- What are we really trying to achieve? (strip away assumptions)
- What are the fundamental constraints? (physics, human nature, etc)
- What is absolutely necessary vs conventional?
- If we started from zero knowledge, how would we build this?
- What assumptions can we challenge?

**Output structure:**
- Core problem broken down to fundamentals
- Assumptions identified and challenged
- Fundamental constraints vs arbitrary ones
- Rebuilt approach from first principles
- Key differences from original idea

- **Green Hat**: Creativity and alternatives (what else is possible?)
- **Blue Hat**: Process and overview (how do we proceed?)

**Output structure:**

### 10. Random Stimulation

**When to use:** To break patterns and discover unexpected connections.
