# /next - Discover Next Story Beat

Discovery writing assistant: suggests the next logical story beat based on current progress.

## Workflow

### STEP 1: Read Current State

Read the story's current state:
- `_meta.md` for premise and status
- `scenes/_outline.md` for scene progression
- Latest scene or draft for current position
- Any freewrite the user just shared

### STEP 2: Analyze Story Momentum

Consider:
- What questions has the story raised but not answered?
- What tension is building?
- What does the reader expect vs. what would surprise them?
- What character needs have not been addressed?

### STEP 3: Suggest Next Beat

Present ONE clear next beat:

**Volgende stap**

[2-3 sentences describing WHAT happens next - not HOW to write it]

**Waarom dit werkt**

[1-2 sentences on story logic: cause-effect, tension, or character need]

**Ruimte voor ontdekking**

[Questions the user can explore while freewriting this beat]

## Rules

- Keep suggestions broad enough for discovery
- Never dictate dialogue or specific scenes
- Focus on WHAT happens, not HOW it's written
- One beat at a time - don't plan ahead
- Match the tone of what's been written
- If no story exists yet: suggest an opening situation based on the premise

## Language

Output in Dutch (user preference), keep technical terms English.
